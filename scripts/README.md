: cut is probably the most useful unix command for me
: you can throw in any delimiter you want right

: +1
: there are a lot of alternatives but the good thing about unix command line arguments is that they are super fast
: a lot of people spent years making them super fast
        also if you open up new shell you can run them in parallel
        and use multiple cores

        ooooh. i feel like i could have used this beforeâ€¦
: so cut and paste do for fixed-length fields what awk does for character-delimited fields, huh?
        cool.
: as long as we're on the topic of fun unix commands, try uniq -c | sort -nr to get a sorted word count
